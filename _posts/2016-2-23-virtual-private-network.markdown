There is no one right definition of democracy, but if we were to comprehend on what it would look like? This world wide web, **The Internet** would be the most example. No surprise that governments and authoritative bodies freak out and try to control and limit what we, the netizens can freely access. However, we don't have to succumb to the atrocities they commit. We can free ourselves from the cages of censorships and firewalls as long as we have the messiah that they call **Virtual Private Network**.

## Basics

There are two types of networks:-
- Public Networks
- Private Networks

**Public Network** just like our internet is available to everyone, whereas **Private Network** has restricted access to only a few. An example of private network would an office network or a college network.

We do not have any control over the wires, router and other hardware that makes up the internet. So while surfing a public network there's a possibility that someone could read our private conversations. Private networks provide that security and privacy but they are not scalable and the cost of establishing a private network is high.

**Virtual Private Network** acronymed as VPN is a best of both worlds situation. It's private network that runs on public network. It uses the infrastructure of public network to provide the functionality of private network. 

A very good analogy to explain the basics of Public Networks, Private Networks and VPNs is given at [howstuffworks.com](http://computer.howstuffworks.com/vpn1.htm)
