title: History of typeof null returning object.
---

Javascript is undoubtedly bit weird at times. However for me, that's what makes it special. 
It holds in itself all the history and culture that brough upon us the dawn of the the internet. Javascript has 6 or 7 (depending upon how you count) types. They are 

* string
* number
* boolean
* object
* symbol (new in es6)
* Null and * undefineddsfsd
